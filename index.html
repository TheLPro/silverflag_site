          We are a team of cybersecurity researchers that are working to make
          the world safe with the rapid changes. We offer a large number of
          services from reverse engineering, network penetration testing,
          malware development, backed development, security awareness
          presentations, network security assessments, and more. We believe in
          the idea that privacy and security are the new most important things
          of the internet, with the rise of tools making it too easy for people
          to attack, its time to make it easy to defend.

            I am a developer from Poland with a strong foundation in
            programming. I love to code, and I'm proficient in several
            programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. These languages enable me to craft visually appealing
            and interactive web applications, which I thoroughly enjoy.

            I love to code, mainly in python and some other languages. I gained
            a large interest in cyber security from friends and family, and it
            slowly has become my main focus and what I am dedicating my life to
            improve. There are a lot of other people like me, there is not much
            about me that is special, but I believe in open source hardware and
            software, so of course I use linux.
